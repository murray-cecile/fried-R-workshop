# Setup Instructions
### Data Analysis for Public Policy

Please complete these three steps before the workshop starts. If you run into issues, we can help troubleshoot, but getting as much of this done beforehand as possible will help save time for learning during the workshop itself.

1. Install R and RStudio

2. Download course materials

3. Download the demo dataset.

## Installing R

If you don't have R or RStudio installed on your computer, please follow these instructions **before the first workshop**. Throughout this process, unless you have a specific reason to do something different, follow the default locations and settings. 

### 1. Download R (the language)

Go to https://cran.r-project.org/ and download the version of R that matches your operating system. Run the .exe file and follow any installation instructions.

### 2. Download RStudio (the IDE)

Go to https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download and download the version of RStudio Desktop that matches your operating system. Double click the file and follow any instructions.

### 3. Check that it worked

Make sure you can open RStudio without getting any error messages. 

### 4. BONUS: install an R package

Try typing the following code into the console (the part where there's a cursor blinking):

`install.packages("tidyverse")`

You'll get a bunch of output that looks like R is downloading something and it will take a minute or two. Keep an eye out for any error messages, but this process should complete automatically. If you do get an error message, please record it somewhere - it will help us troubleshoot.

## Download course materials

You can find the course materials in my GitHub repo at https://github.com/murray-cecile/fried-R-workshop. Here's how you download and unzip them:

1. Go to https://github.com/murray-cecile/fried-R-workshop/tree/master/WORKSHOP-MATERIALS.

2. Click on the ZIP file you want to download. This will take you to a new page.

3. Find the "Download" button on the right half of the page (above where it says "View raw" and next to a button that says "History"), and click it. The file should download.

4. Move that ZIP file from your Downloads folder (or wherever it ended up) to some other location on your computer where you normally work with files. Your Documents folder might be a good choice here, but the location doesn't matter as long as you know where it is.

5. Unzip the ZIP file. Usually you can do this by double-clicking on the file, or right-clicking on it and selecting Unzip.

6. You should get a folder containing the exact same materials listed in [this part](https://github.com/murray-cecile/fried-R-workshop/tree/master/01-workshop) of the GitHub site.

## Download demo dataset

1. Go to https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2018/3i3m-jwuy.

2. Find and click on the button that says "Export" on the right side of the page (right below the "Find in this dataset" search bar). 

3. From the Download drop down, underneath where it says "Download a copy of this dataset in a static format," choose the CSV format. Clicking this should start a file download.

4. Move that file into the same folder where you saved the course materials. 

Thanks for working through these [installation](https://xkcd.com/1367/) steps.

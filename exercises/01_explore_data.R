# EXPLORING YOUR DATA
#===============================================================================#

# What are the columns in your dataset? What are the rows?

# Can you look at your data in the console? 

# What about in the data viewer?


# here are some questions to try answering:
# - how many unique observations are there? (often but not always # rows)
# - what are the mean, median, sum of different variables?
# - how many different categories are there, and how many observations in each category?
# - what data types are there? which ones are easy to work with?

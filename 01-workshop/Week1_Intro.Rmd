```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
libs <- c("here", "tidyverse", "magrittr", "knitr", "kableExtra", "janitor")
lapply(libs, library, character.only = TRUE)
```

## Course goals

- Learn how to perform basic data analysis tasks in R
- Learn some fundamental programming concepts that will help with learning new tools
- Learn *when* and *how* writing code is better than Excel: choosing the right tool for the job

## About you

- Name and preferred pronouns
- Year and major
- Have you ever programmed before?

## Overview of today

1. Talk about when doing data analysis programmatically is advantageous
2. Introduce the tools we'll be using in this series
3. Start playing with real data

## Code of conduct

- Be respectful of others' time 
- Show courtesy to your classmates (and instructors)
- Gracefully accept feedback

## Why write code?

## Why write code?

Some advantages:

- easier to check (in some ways)
- reproducible
- scalable
- perform more sophisticated analyses (e.g. regression, machine learning)

## Why write code?

Some advantages:

- easier to check (in some ways)
- reproducible
- scalable
- perform more sophisticated analyses (e.g. regression, machine learning)


Some disadvantages:

- less accessible to broad audiences
- can be more opaque
- can be more time-consuming
- more vulnerable to certain kinds of errors

## About learning to code

- Above all, it takes a ton of **practice** (and a lot of Googling)
- Understanding key concepts and terms helps guide that self-directed learning
- Learning is continuous because new tools are always being developed 

## Writing "good" code

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/code_quality.png")
```

https://style.tidyverse.org/

## Why use R?

```{r whyR, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
use_cases <- c("Free?",
               "Nice user interface",
               "Ease of data assembly",
               "Ease of descriptive stats",
               "Quality of visualization",
               "More complex modeling",
               "General-purpose programming")

tools <- c("Excel", "Stata", "Python", "R")

r <- c("Yes", "Yes", "Excellent", "Very good", "Excellent", "Yes", "Yes")
excel <- c("No*", "Yes", "Good", "Very good", "Good", "No", "No")
stata <- c("No", "Yes", "Good", "Excellent", "Mediocre", "Yes", "No")
python <- c("Yes", "No", "Good", "Good", "Good", "Yes", "Yes")

# make a table out of these
tibble(use_cases, excel, stata, python, r) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Comparing common data analysis tools", 
        col.names = c("", tools)) %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD") %>% 
  add_footnote("*But your organization probably already paid for MS Office")
```

::: notes

- it can do many things that Excel can't
- free and open-source, unlike Excel or Stata: makes it easy to develop own 


:::

## R vs. RStudio

R = the programming language

RStudio = an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, aka a nice interface

## Demo

## Exercise

1. Find and download a dataset you think is interesting.

    - Chicago open datasets: https://data.cityofchicago.org
    - U.S. Census Bureau data: https://data.census.gov/cedsci/
    - U.S. government data portal: https://data.gov/
    - World Bank data portal: https://data.worldbank.org/
    - Eclectic archive: https://data.world/jsvine/data-is-plural-archive


2. Load the data into R. 

3. Explore it - try to learn 3-5 facts from summarizing the data.

4. Share with your classmates!
